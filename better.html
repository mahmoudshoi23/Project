                <h1 id="tit">The Amazing World of Gumball:</h1>
                <p>(simply known as TAWOG[b] or Gumball) is an animated sitcom created by Ben Bocquelet for Cartoon
                    Network and distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television.[2] The series concerns the lives of
                    12-year-old Gumball Watterson, an anthropomorphic blue cat, and adoptive goldfish brother Darwin,
                    who attend middle school in the fictional city of Elmore, California. They often find themselves in
                    various shenanigans around the city, during which they interact with fellow family members—younger
                    sister Anais, mother Nicole, and father Richard—and an extended supporting cast of characters.</p>
                <p>Bocquelet based several of the series' characters on rejected characters from his previous commercial
                    work while making its premise a mixture of "family shows and school shows", which Cartoon Network
                    was heavily interested in.[3] After Bocquelet pitched The Amazing World of Gumball to the network,
                    Turner Broadcasting executive Daniel Lennard green-lit the production of the series. The show was
                    produced by Cartoon Network Studios Europe, in association with Boulder Media (Ireland; season 1)
                    and Studio Soi (Germany; seasons 2–6).</p>
                <p>Gumball is often noted for its intentional stylistic disunity, with characters designed, filmed, and
                    animated using various styles and techniques, oftentimes within the same scene (stylized traditional
                    animation, puppetry, CGI, stop motion, Flash animation, live-action, etc.).[4] The series has
                    received critical acclaim and since developed a cult following, with particular praises for its
                    extensive references to popular and Internet culture, sarcasm, subtle innuendos, dark humor, and
                    metahumor.[5][6] Although it is a children's series, Gumball also comments on topics that are often
                    considered serious or mature, including philosophy, marriage, cyberbullying, political intolerance,
                    mental illness, and the human condition.</p>

                <h1 id="tie">Watterson family:</h1>
                <p>The Watterson family are anthropomorphic animals, and are quite unusual; they consist of two rabbits,
                    two cats, and a goldfish.

                    Gumball and Nicole are both blue cats, while Anais and Richard are both pink rabbits. Darwin is a
                    goldfish, and was originally the family pet until he grew legs, gained the ability to speak, and
                    became able to eat food other than fish flakes.

                    Granny Jojo is Richard's mother, and Nicole's father, Daniel Senicourt, was mentioned in "The End"
                    and "The Man" before making his debut in "The Choices" alongside his wife, Nicole's mother Mary.
                    Richard's father, Frankie, was mentioned as well in "The Watch" and "The Man" before making his
                    first appearance in "The Signature." Louie is the most recent addition to the family as he married
                    Granny Jojo in "The Man."</p>
